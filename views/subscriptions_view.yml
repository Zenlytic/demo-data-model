  This view provides a comprehensive overview of customer subscriptions for Pure
  Organics products, including details such as the subscription ID, product ID,

  month, quarter, or year, providing valuable insights into customer behavior
  and subscription patterns. Additionally, the `number_of_active_subscriptions`
  measure provides a count of the total number of active subscriptions, allowing
  you to track subscription growth over time and identify popular products. Use

  preferences and optimize your subscription offerings to drive revenue and
  growth.

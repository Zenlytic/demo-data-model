  indicating marketing strategies linked to each order. The model differentiates
  between 'SUBSCRIPTION_VS_OTP' to track subscription versus one-time purchases,
  and includes 'MARKETING_SOURCE' and 'CHANNELS' for attribution insights.
  Revenue fields such as 'TOTAL_GROSS_REVENUE' and 'TOTAL_NET_REVENUE' help
  evaluate financial performance. The model also measures customer behavior and
  purchasing patterns through 'NEW_VS_REPEAT,' and detailed metrics like
  'REPURCHASE_RATE' and 'NET_MARGIN,' supporting strategy optimization across
  marketing and sales.
